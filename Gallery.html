                        <h5>   Crisis in Humanity</h5>
                        <p>A humanitarian crisis is described by the dictionary as "one event or a series of events that pose a threat to the health, safety, or well-being of a community or large group of people."The phenomena served as a magnificent protest against the period of resurgent fascism and blatant historical revisionism in Bencab's work. With the artwork in hand, the artist joined Karapatan: Artists Stand for Human Rights in 2017. I agreed to take part in the Vargas Museum's current display of huge drawings because it had a human rights theme. 'Crisis in Humanity' is the name of my drawing, he said.</p>

                        <h5>Sabel</h5>
                        <p>Sabel is undoubtedly Bencab's most recognizable creation. The artist used to live in Bambang, where Sabel was a homeless wanderer who strolled the city's streets.The muse captivated the artist's attention as she went around searching for food while wearing improvised attire made of disposable plastic sheets.

                        <h5> Edo Gesture </h5>
                         <p>Bencab took inspiration for the Edo Gesture from the ukiyo-e, a combination of the Japanese words uki (to float) and yo (world). This alludes to the transience of all earthly life, according to the artist.

                        <p>Bencab's tribute to his wife, British journalist Caroline Kennedy, is titled The Portrait of Caroline.The couple wed in London in 1969 after meeting in Manila in 1986. They had three kids together. Elisar, the oldest, was born in 1971. Mayumi, the middle kid, was born in 1973, and Jasmine, the youngest, in 1977.

                        <h5>Yellow Confetti</h5>
                         <p>One of the most contentious Filipino artworks in modern times is Yellow Confetti by Bencab. To define the civil resistance in the Philippines during the EDSA People Power Uprising, it was invented in the early to mid-1980s. The proletariats crowded the subway and raised their fists in protest, as Yellow Confetti perfectly captured.
